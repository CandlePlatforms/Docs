# Tokenomics

Candle was launched on December 30th, 2021. The maximum supply is one-hundred billion. Forty billion will be allocated to the staking rewards programs described elsewhere in this docs. This initial LP campaign will distribute the vast majority of candle to early adopters and supporters within the community. Another forty billion will be held in a multisig gnosis safe, which is owned by the CandleGovernor smart contract. This is so only passed proposals can manage the tokens in this safe, so the community decides what they wish to do and has control over it. Five billion will be allocated to developer grants, and fifteen billion will be allocated for early developers with a two year lockup.&#x20;
