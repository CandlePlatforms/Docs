# For Engineers

(1) Candle token is built on Ethereum, a scalable network for such applications and tokens. It is used in conjunction with the (2) web app to allow users to burn their tokens by pressing on the (3) Burn button and typing their message into the message box. The (4) Candle Smart Contract is deployed on Ethereum, and is the formation and logic behind the Candle token. The (5) Candle Burn smart contract is our custom built solution for allowing the functionality of the Burn button and message box mentioned earlier. After a burn and accompanying message are on the blockchain, the (6) Candle Burn Explorer fetches all instances of this and displays it and other useful information on a webpage, allowing users and others to visualize and see data and history. (7) Candle CVI is the Candle Confession Volatility Index, which is tracked against the use of the burn function and messages that are categorized as confessions.
